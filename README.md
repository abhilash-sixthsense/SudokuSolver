# SudokuSolver

### A simple Sudoku solver implemented using a backtracking algorithm.

### Setup

1. Create a virtual environment named .venv:

```
python -m venv .venv
```

2. Install the required dependencies:

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Usage

- Update the Sudoku puzzle in the Excel file.
The solver will automatically read the puzzle from the ActiveProblem sheet.

- CSV-based puzzles can also be solved with a small code change.

- Run the solver:

```
python main.py
